# Introducing PW3 (Pkt Wallet Web Wrapper)

PW3 is an extension for the official PKT CLI Wallet that was started with the intention of providing a visual interface while retaining full functionality of the cli wallet.

The software is powered by NodeJS & is available to be configured as a host on all platforms that support running both NodeJS & The PKT CLI Wallet.

PW3 only needs to run on a single pc, you can potentially view it on any device with a web browser.

The primary transmission technologies are web based (http / https).

PW3 is intended to be ran on a closed network space, I.E behind a VPN (& or) Reverse Web Proxy with access control lists.

A guide is in progress, it will detail how to make use of a free p2p VPN connection provided by one or more third party services to access your wallet securely from a wide range of devices. (see: https://tailscale.com/ for a zero config option)

## Why

PW3 has two simple goals:

- Simplicity
- Accessibility

PW3 was envisioned to enable as many devices as possible to control / administrate a pkt wallet, we chose the official pkt cli wallet as the underlying block chain wallet mechanism due to it's wide feature set & consistent software stability. Many users often prefer the cli wallet but find the lack of visual features to be off-putting, PW3 aims to change that.

## Features
- Graphical interface
- Automatic / Manual Folding support
- Localized content focus (your data, your machine, all data is aimed at being stored on the same machine hosting the wallet)
- PKT Sending Wizard
- Wallet address generation
- QOL Fixes & Error handling extending beyond CLI
